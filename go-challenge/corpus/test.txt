Thank you! Thank you! Thank you all very, very much! Thank you for that amazing welcome! Thank you all for the great convention that we've had.  And Chelsea, thank you. I am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thank you for bringing Mark into our family and Charlotte and Aidan into the world. And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago...  ...it is still going strong.
